Education
======
* B.Eng in Biomedical Engineering (Honour) & B.S. in Medical Science, University Of Sydney
* B.Eng exchange in Biomedical Engineering, Denmark Technical University 

Research experience
======
* Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Research Intern
  * Supervisor: Prof. [Sung-Jan, Lin](http://sjlin.cm.ntu.edu.tw/web/home)
  * Designed a novel data collection proposal for whole mice retina single cell mapping and providing mapping data after ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R) after different days by using 2-photon, leading to see clear 3-D retina single cell photo.
  * Interpreted the results of new cell type retina death after I/R injury and presented research progress every week, which outlined possible gene for immunofluorescent staining.

* Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Student Researcher
  * Supervisor: Prof. [Sue-Wei, Lin](https://sueweilin.wixsite.com/linlab)
  * Utilized fluorescent staining and confocal imaging by dissecting over 500 drosophila’s brains, detecting low level of a tubulin type in mushroom body, which correlates with high-salt diet induced learning defect regarding tubulins.
  * Collaborated with PhD student to experiment with new ideas that critical cells of olfactory sensation engaging in decision making for appetitive training using optogenetic.
  * Implemented insect crawling timer and related paper web crawler by Python, improving the data analysis efficiency about 30% and accuracy improve around 7% in two months.

* Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Student Researcher
  * Evaluated the sleep fragmentation of fruit flies after consuming a high-salt diet using a DAM machine. 
  * Interpreted salt concentration in food as a “high-salt diet” for drosophila, which had never been defined in related works before. 

Skills
======
* Programming: CSS/HTML, Python, R
* Tools: Confocal, 2-photon microscopy, Arduino, CAD and 3D printing design, animal behavior study, Excel VBA
* Laboratory: PCR, Immunostaining, genetic transformation, gram staining, cell/bacterial culture, electrophoresis, ELISA, drosophila brain dissection, mouse retina dissection, cre protein
  
Service and leadership
======
