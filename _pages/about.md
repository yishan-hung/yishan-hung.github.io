I'm currently a forth year student studying B.Eng in Biomedical Engineering (Honor) & B.S. in Medical Science at the University of Sydney with a passion for turning ideas into real-world healthcare solutions. My journey has taken me from independent research on cognition and memory as Research Intern with [Prof. Sung-Jan Lin](http://sjlin.cm.ntu.edu.tw/web/home) in Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica. I recently returned from my exchange jorney from Denmark, where I explored sustainable health tech with Engineers Without Borders - DK and product design during my exchange at the Technical University of Denmark. I’ve also explored human–AI interaction in HAI-centre with [Prof. Chin-Teng Lin](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Chin-Teng.Lin) at the University of Technology Sydney. 

I thrive at the intersection of science, technology, and empathy, and I’m especially interested in how innovation can improve accessibility, equity, and patient outcomes. Outside of my studies, you’ll often find me collaborating on interdisciplinary projects, exploring new tools (from CAD to Python), or learning from different cultures and perspectives.
